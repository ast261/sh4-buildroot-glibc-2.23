This is a special Buildroot version for the Renesas SuperH (sh) architecture.
It can currently be used under the following conditions:

- target architecture: SuperH
- target architecture variant: sh4 little-endian
- glibc: 2.23

Branch "idl4k-toolchain" contains the sh4 toolchain based on:
- kernel-header: 2.6.32.42
- glibc: 2.23
- binutils: 2.35.2
- gcc 10.3.0
- gdb 11.1

Because of a hang in the old glibc version, the toolchain must be build with make < 4.4.
This toolchain has been tested on
- platform: idl4k (Inverto Digital Labs)
- cpu type: STx7108

Buildroot is a simple, efficient and easy-to-use tool to generate embedded
Linux systems through cross-compilation.

The documentation can be found in docs/manual. You can generate a text
document with 'make manual-text' and read output/docs/manual/manual.text.
Online documentation can be found at http://buildroot.org/docs.html

To build and use the buildroot stuff, do the following:

1) run 'make menuconfig'
2) select the target architecture and the packages you wish to compile
3) run 'make'
4) wait while it compiles
5) find the kernel, bootloader, root filesystem, etc. in output/images

You do not need to be root to build or run buildroot.  Have fun!

Buildroot comes with a basic configuration for a number of boards. Run
'make list-defconfigs' to view the list of provided configurations.

Please feed suggestions, bug reports, insults, and bribes back to the
buildroot mailing list: buildroot@buildroot.org
You can also find us on #buildroot on OFTC IRC.
